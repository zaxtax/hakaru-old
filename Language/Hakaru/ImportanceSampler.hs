-- This is an interpreter that's like Interpreter except conditioning is
-- checked at run time rather than by static types.  In other words, we allow
-- models to be compiled whose conditioned parts do not match the observation
-- inputs.  In exchange, we get to make Measure an instance of Monad, and we
-- can express models whose number of observations is unknown at compile time.
